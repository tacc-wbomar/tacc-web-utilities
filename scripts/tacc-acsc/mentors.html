<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>A Google search revealed that careers in technology can be lucrative. I have enjoyed the program, collecting certificates, internships, research experiences for undergraduates, and networking with colleagues, mentors, and professors along the way.
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid and why?</strong>
<br>I wanted to join the military because I thought it was cool. Everyone in my family served in the Army, so I grew up in a military household.
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>A perfect day would be one where the sun is shining and there’s a soft breeze. My family and I would be gathered outside, grilling some food while the sound of island and Samoan music filled the air, blending in with everyone’s laughter.
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong>
<br>Climate change affects Samoan culture and the broader Pacific Islands, threatening the land and livelihoods of many island communities. Rising sea levels, more intense storms, and shifting weather patterns put coastal villages at risk of flooding, erode shorelines, and affect agriculture, especially taro and other traditional crops vital to Samoan life.
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>My grandparents always told me, “Pray for guidance and always believe in yourself.”
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>I would rather be without the Internet because I go crazy without my phone. I tend to ignore my surroundings when using my phone and practically live under a rock, so I can easily live without the Internet.

<h3>Frank Lujan II</h3>
<p><strong>Academic Institution/Employer:</strong>
<br>University of Guam</p>
<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>
<br>Master of Science in Environmental Science, Research Associate I</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>The program is interdisciplinary. I can combine my interests in data science with conservation practices in endangered species found around Guam.
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid and why?</strong>
<br>I was always interested in becoming a biologist or conservation biologist. Growing up in Guam exposed me to issues like coral reef management and island sustainability. Watching conservationists like Steve Irwin further sparked my interest in this field. Through their excitement in the work and the endless possibilities of how conservation could be done made me realize that this could be a potential job for me in the future.
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>The perfect day would be spending time with friends and loved ones. I love hiking and going to the beach, snorkeling with my friends and seeing the various organisms underwater. To end the day, I’d take time for myself and either watch TV or meditate.
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong>
<br>As a native Chamorro from Guam, the increasing strength of typhoons and the rising number of coral bleaching events has had a significant effect on our island community and way of life. Climate change is an important issue we must address to better prepare our communities for the future.
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Best of luck! You’ve got this! And remember, it’s okay to fail.
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>While I always have my phone near me, I think it would be easier to live in the moment and not be glued to the screen, so I’ll give up the phone.

<h3>Nancy Mahmoud</h3>
<p><strong>Academic Institution/Employer:</strong>
<br>UC Santa Barbara</p>
<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>
<br>Biopsychology</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I am a pre-dental student and could have majored in biology. I figured I would already be studying biology, so I wanted to do something a little more interesting. I chose biopsychology because I have always been fascinated by the brain and see it as an interesting and complex topic.
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid and why?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be a doctor. Science fascinated me, but I knew that I did not want to spend my life in a lab. I love the possibilities of working with patients and tracking their treatment plans as they work toward healthier lifestyles.
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>Spending all day at the beach and having a picnic with my best friends is optimal.
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong>
<br>I grew up in a gentrified area and saw vast differences in access to healthcare in different parts of the Bay Area. These discrepancies inspired me to research reasons for the disparities in the healthcare system.
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Everyone has their own path. Don’t compare yourself to others because everyone has a different story.
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>I would rather be without Internet because I rely too much on my phone, as does most of the population.

<h3>Kole Nagai</h3>
<p><strong>Academic Institution/Employer:</strong>
<br>Chaminade University</p>
<p><strong>Field of Study</strong>
<br>Data Science major, Economics minor</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I was curious about data analysis. After a semester, I realized that I enjoyed studying data analysis and using computers and statistics to help present said data.
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid and why?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be an engineer. I would design and build things as a kid. Legos and building blocks were my biggest inspiration.
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>I wake up, walk my dog, have breakfast, then go to school. Traffic is minimal, and I find a good parking spot. School is productive and I can hang with my friends in-between and after classes. Get my homework done early, play video games and fall sleep at a reasonable time.
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong>
<br>Wages in America are far too low. If workers earned livable wages, issues like housing costs, homelessness, and rising prices in the U.S. could be resolved. 
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Pace yourself. Relax and don’t overthink everything. You still have time to figure things out.
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>I’ll keep my phone. The purpose of a phone is to communicate, something I see as more important than anything the Internet could provide.

<h3>Omar Ocasio</h3>
<p><strong>Academic Institution/Employer:</strong>
<br>Wovenware a Maxar Company</p>
<p><strong>Field of Study/Job Title</strong>
<br>Geospatial Image Technician 1</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I chose Computer Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico Bayamon Campus because I wanted to learn more about the core fundamentals of what makes a computer work and how I can improve my own creative and critical thinking skills.
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid and why?</strong>
<br>As a teenager, I was into music and technology. I wanted to study music but ended up learning about technology thanks to my father (rest in peace). He helped me with learning how things worked, not just in tech but in music, mechanics, computers, engineering, and life.
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>There wouldn’t be any traffic on my commute to work and my car wouldn’t make any expensive noises. I wouldn’t have any Internet connection issues and would feel motivated to complete my tasks. After work, I’d enjoy a hassle-free commute back home and play my guitars.
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong>
<br>Economies have changed drastically in recent years, and for the lower class, that change has been for the worse. I share bills, food costs, and groceries with two roommates, and sometimes we struggle to make ends meet. Even will full-time jobs, we barely have enough for savings and emergencies after paying bills.
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>There’s always a reason to try, even when you fail. Mistakes are what drive us to want more, to do better. Everything happens for a reason.
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>If you take away my phone, I can still use the Internet to communicate with the people I need to reach. The Internet also gives you access to information on almost everything.

<h3>Angella Osinde</h3>
<p><strong>Academic Institution/Employer:</strong>
<br>Target</p>
<p><strong>Field of Study/Job Title</strong>
<br>Tech + Style Associate</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I majored in Graphic Design with a minor in Computer Science at Mississippi State because that allowed me to blend my creative passions with technology. The Computer Science minor gave me foundational knowledge in theory and programming, particularly in Python.

<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid and why?</strong>
<br>I went back and forth between wanting to be a fashion designer and a musician because both fields allowed for self-expression, creativity, and curiosity. I’ve always had a passion for music and still play the viola in community orchestras, occasionally performing on the piano at my local church. With fashion, I admire the creativity and dedication required to develop original ideas.
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>I envision spending the day hanging out with friends, engaging in creative activities, and exploring new adventures like trying out a charming coffee shop. In the evening, I’d unwind by binge-watching my favorite shows or indulging in a creative project, such as painting.
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong>
<br>Equity in education is crucial. I witnessed firsthand the transformative power of education through my involvement with HERS-EA, a nonprofit founded by my mother that empowers women through educational opportunities. My mother’s own story is an example of that, and without her education, I would not be where I am today.
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Stay focused, remain disciplined, and work toward my goals while embracing change and the journey of self-discovery. College is a unique time for exploration, and it’s important to be open to new experiences.
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>I’d give up my phone because I believe it’s beneficial to unplug and be present in my own space. I am often less productive and have a harder time relaxing when I spend too much time on the phone.
