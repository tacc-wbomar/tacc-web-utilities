Traffic is minimal, and I find a good parking spot. School is productive and I can hang with my friends in-between and after classes. Get my homework done early, play video games and fall sleep at a reasonable time.<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong><br>Wages in America are far too low. If workers earned livable wages, issues like housing costs, homelessness, and rising prices in the U.S. could be resolved.<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong><br>Pace yourself.

I pursued an MBA in Marketing because I needed to strengthen my understanding of marketing essentials, especially how to effectively communicate my work.<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid and why?</strong><br>I went back and forth between wanting to be a fashion designer and a musician because both fields allowed for self-expression, creativity, and curiosity. I\u2019ve always had a passion for music and still play the viola in community orchestras, occasionally performing on the piano at my local church. With fashion, I admire the creativity and dedication required to develop original ideas.<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong><br>I envision spending the day hanging out with friends, engaging in creative activities, and exploring new adventures like trying out a charming coffee shop. In the evening, I\u2019d unwind by binge-watching my favorite shows or indulging in a creative project, such as painting.<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about and why?</strong><br>Equity in education is crucial. I witnessed firsthand the transformative power of education through my involvement with HERS-EA, a nonprofit founded by my mother that empowers women through educational opportunities. My mother\u2019s own story is an example of that, and without her education, I would not be where I am today.<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong><br>Stay focused, remain disciplined, and work toward my goals while embracing change and the journey of self-discovery. College is a unique time for exploration, and it\u2019s important to be open to new experiences.<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong><br>I\u2019d give up my phone because I believe it\u2019s beneficial to unplug and be present in my own space. I am often less productive and have a harder time relaxing when I spend too much time on the phone."
