<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I chose these two majors because they allow me to visualize my thoughts and help the helpless.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be an anthropologist. I used to watch the show <em>Bones</em> with my mom and think of how cool it was &ldquo;bringing people back from the dead.&rdquo; As I matured, I realized how much work went into it and decided to not to go that route.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>My perfect day consists of sleeping, eating, and enjoying peace and serenity.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Health care is important to me because I've seen how the people around me neglect their health concerns due to cost. The same lack of access because of finances also applies to mental health care. For many communities, mental health remains a niche topic and is frowned upon to openly discuss.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>We are all human. If you effectively communicate your position, there is a good chance that the other person will understand you.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>You can do so much without a phone, especially if you have another device that's connected to the Internet. Without the Internet, there isn't much you can do with your phone, anyway.</p>

<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>I care about how technology is subtly taking over and encroaching on our lives, and how we often inherit assumptions about it without critically examining them.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Follow the fun. By doing so, you will enjoy the journey, even if it doesn't work out.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>A phone is just a medium, but being without the Internet would mean losing access to information and resources. It would be like having no library at all. I rely on the Internet for reading and researching, so it's far more important.</p>

<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be a video game developer because I know the positive impacts they can have on people. Video games offer an escape and a way to enjoy oneself in a virtual world. As someone who has played an extensive amount of video games, I yearned to be part of creating one myself.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>It would be a beautiful, sunny day where the temperature is a bit chilly. My girlfriend and I would go to the mall and see where the day takes us. We'd grab food, look around, and just enjoy each other's company. At the end of the day, we'd go back home, watch TV, and fall asleep on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Inequality is a prominent issue in society. As a person of color, I have faced many barriers in life, where I have had to work twice as hard to reach my goals. There is so much fear and hatred in the world, and we must address this issue to create a more peaceful society.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Try to experience as many things as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>Phones often serve as a distraction. Though life would become a bit harder because of how integrated smartphones are in our everyday lives, I could find workarounds using the Internet.</p>

<br>I'd wake up at 5 a.m. to exercise, followed by breakfast, reading, and studying or working. The afternoon would consist of lunch, a creative outlet, more reading, and rest.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Global socioeconomic inequalities encompass many things. The global north causes most of the world's pollution, yet the global south gets the bigger burden given their natural climate and weaker environmental infrastructure. There are many examples of similar power disparities.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Be cautious about how you identify yourself relative to your career and get comfortable with potential failures. Finally, you'll never know what relationships and activities will open new doors for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>During my senior year of high school, I had no idea what I wanted to pursue and was planning to start college without a declared major. I enrolled in an Introduction to Programming course and loved it, even when I struggled. After this class, I decided computer science is what I wanted to pursue.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be a teacher. I have a little sister who is seven years younger, and whenever my mom would be busy around the house, I would begin teaching my sister fun math problems to solve. I also assigned her homework that I would make up and grade. I loved putting gold star stickers on her assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>The day would start with breakfast with my family in the backyard. Afterward, I'd make my way to the beach in Jenner, California, which is one of my favorite places. I'd go on a picnic with my best friends and take photos with my Polaroid. Later, my family and I would go watch a movie in theaters.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Food insecurity is a big stressor which can lead to health and social issues and a decline in educational achievement. Mental health is a topic which has been looked down upon, especially in immigrant households. Creating a more supportive environment that encourages being able to speak up and prioritize mental health would be amazing.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Apply for an opportunity, even if you don't fit all the requirements or don't feel like you can do it. There is a fear of failure, and you need to get out of your comfort zone to build confidence. We miss all the shots we don't take.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>I would rather be without my phone because if I still have Internet access, I can use other devices to stay connected and be entertained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>As a high school freshman, I was unsure what career path I wanted to pursue. I found myself in math class listening to a presentation about a free summer camp centered on robotics. Applying to the camp felt intimidating, but the fact that a woman was presenting gave me the confidence I needed. I felt inspired listening to her presentation as she explained that women are needed in STEM.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be a veterinarian because I love animals, but when I learned you must put animals down at times, I changed course.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>Hanging out with my friends on a crisp, 75-degree day.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Education equality is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty and promoting social mobility in underrepresented communities. Many students lack access to the resources, infrastructure, and support systems needed to thrive academically.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I considered the medical field but never felt truly passionate about it. Then, I explored law, which I stuck with for a while because I liked its structure. However, I eventually realized that it wasn't something I could see myself doing long-term, and I knew I wouldn't be happy in that career. Since I'm passionate about computer and data science, my goal is to help shed more light on the opportunities in the field for other students.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>My dad is a dentist with his own practice. I saw how hard he worked and how people were always impressed with what he did, and I admired that. On Maui, we always say <em>Mr. Aloha</em> to describe someone who seems to know everyone. Seeing the kind of positive impact he had on so many people made me want to follow in his footsteps and become <em>Ms. Aloha</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>After brunch with my grandma at our favorite restaurant, I'd pick up my high school friends to head to the farmers market up in the countryside and catch up on life. Afterward, I'd head downtown to play tennis. After tennis, we'd all head back to my house, cook a big meal for everyone, and sit around sharing stories, laughing, and enjoying each other's company.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>&ldquo;Priced out of paradise&rdquo; is a thought that lingers in the back of my mind, and I know it's the same for many others living in Hawai'i. Some of us are fortunate enough to attend college and pursue careers that could allow us to live comfortably, but that's not the case for everyone. It's becoming harder to afford to live on the islands, even with what is considered a well-paying job. It's hard to think about coming back to a place that once felt like home and realizing no one you know will be there to greet you.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Struggle now, and you can smile later. I once told my older sister, &ldquo;You must be really smart to be a biology major,&rdquo; and she replied, &ldquo;No, I'm not. I just work hard. I struggle most of the time, but that's necessary for growth and learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;smile&rdquo; part comes from my parents. In second grade, we had a school dinner where parents wrote something on a rock for us to keep. My mom wrote &ldquo;smile.&rdquo; She had a lighthearted nature that brought laughter and joy to those around her. Unfortunately, she passed away suddenly from a heart attack when I was only 12, so her reminder to smile holds an even deeper meaning for me.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>My phone allows me to stay connected with friends and family. Without the Internet, I'd still have my loved ones to talk to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I was drawn to computer science for both its technical challenges and the creativity it allows in solving real-world problems. Whether it's improving accessibility, developing innovative software, or tackling social issues with technology, computer science offers endless opportunities to make a meaningful impact on the world.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>Inspired by the tall buildings and strong bridges, I wanted to be an architect. I was fascinated by how architecture combines creativity and engineering to create structures that serve practical purposes and shape the environment. I admired the intricate details and the vision behind each structure, which fueled my desire to contribute to the world through design and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>My perfect day starts with a peaceful morning, enjoying a glass of matcha while reading a captivating book. I'd spend the morning working on a creative coding project, perhaps developing an app for a digital closet or something related to fashion. Afterward, I'd meet up with friends for lunch, sharing ideas and laughs. At night, I'd enjoy a cozy dinner with family, discussing our day and laughing until our stomachs hurt.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>The lack of equitable access to quality education in STEM fields for underrepresented groups resonates with me as a first-generation student. Education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty and creating opportunities. Addressing this issue can lead to a more innovative workforce and empower individuals to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to their communities.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Time never stops, so spend it doing what you love. This perspective encourages me to embrace my passions and take risks, reminding me that failure is a valuable part of the learning process. Rather than fearing mistakes, I view them as opportunities for growth and self-discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>While my phone is a convenient tool for communication and staying organized, the Internet provides a wealth of information, resources, and opportunities for learning and connection. Being without my phone would be challenging, but I could adapt and find alternative ways to communicate.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>Business administration is about leadership, networking, and action. The skills, experiences, and opportunities I am developing align with a career in business. I want to show my culture and community how diverse and moldable I can be while developing an understanding of important organizational practices, culture, and human relations.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I loved the dental practice I went to as a kid, so my mom encouraged me become a dentist. I worked as a dental technician in Hawaii and quickly discovered that I didn't want to become a dentist.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>I'd spend time at my favorite beach on Kauai, enjoying the blue skies and a light breeze. My loved ones would join me for tasty food and good music. We'd sing karaoke and start a bonfire grilling fresh fish from the day's catch.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Truth &mdash; it does not dismiss error, but it does dismiss unawareness and conceptual blindness. Truth is the foundation of nature and evolvement. To form important bridges of understanding between challenging circumstances in society, we need a basis of truth. Some believe that believing in truth means societal change impossible, but I believe truth is the soil that produces the best results.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>If you're going to sit at the table, <em>sit at the table</em>! The world won't wait for you to decide you are great. Since embracing this concept, I have taken risks, chased opportunities, and seen how far I can push myself to learn about what it means to take the seat that has always been mine. The opportunity to participate in ACSC is a great example.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>I can use my laptop to access the Internet and perform the same functions as a phone. The only inconvenience of the laptop is the size.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I'm drawn to the technical side of things and computer science had a bit too much math for my taste. CIS is the perfect middle ground.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be president of the United States because it seemed like a steppingstone to achieving my goal of becoming president of Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>After a refreshing morning run, I'd enjoy a nice cup of coffee before getting ready for the day. I would tackle all my tasks and spend the afternoon going out with friends. At the end of the day, I'd unwind by watching a movie while petting my cat, wrapping up the day on a calmer note.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>As an immigrant and a child of an immigrant family who grew up in an immigrant community, I witnessed firsthand the challenges that were common in my environment but often overlooked. I believe these challenges stem from a lack of resources and the need for these communities to have their voices heard.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>After you've established yourself in your desired career, don't forget your roots. When you make it out of the well, remember to throw the rope back down for others. This way, you will pave the path for others that wasn't laid out for you. As a first-generation college student, this advice is meaningful to me because I have younger family members who aspire to pursue higher education but aren't familiar with the process.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>Technology has significantly influenced my career path and demonstrated the numerous possibilities for creating a positive impact in the world. This realization continues to motivate me to grow so I can maximize its potential to address the causes that matter to me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I've always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world and wanted to contribute to advancing innovations in areas like software development, AI, and computational problem-solving. I added Spanish as a second major to strengthen my communication skills, connect with a wider range of people, and to bring my cultural background into the work I do. I believe being bilingual opens doors for collaboration across borders and helps bridge the gap between tech and diverse communities.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I always wanted to work in information technology because I was fascinated with how computers and other tech worked. I loved tinkering with devices and figuring out how to fix things.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>After completing my assignments and projects, I'd spend time with friends playing games, going out for activities, or just hanging out. The balance between productive work and personal time with the people I care about makes me feel fulfilled and recharged.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Every student, regardless of their background, has the chance to pursue their dreams. Education is one of the most powerful tools for changing someone's life, and it's unfair that so many students don't have access to the same quality resources or support because of where they live.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Never give up. Keep pushing forward, even when things get tough. College can be challenging, but I've learned that persistence is key. It's important to keep your goals in mind, work hard, and believe that your dreams are worth the effort.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>While phones are convenient for communication, the Internet offers many more opportunities for learning, accessing information, and staying connected to the world. The Internet is essential for research, online education, and staying up to date with current events. It's a powerful tool that I rely on for both my studies and my personal interests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I discovered my passion for coding after taking an AP Computer Science class in high school. The ability to create anything I could imagine through programming felt like a form of art, and I enjoyed the creative freedom it offered. I wanted to develop skills that would allow me to solve real-world problems and innovate in various fields. The demand for technology professionals is high, making it a practical career path.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to customize cars, giving them stylish designs and aggressive exhaust sounds. This is due to repeatedly watching <em>Cars</em> when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>I'd spend most of the day relaxing and enjoying nature. I'd also get my grades back for exams that I passed. To end the day, I would take a walk around a beautiful lake, taking in the scenery, thinking about how far I have come in life. When the sky is orange and slight red in the evening, the sun would leave my skin feeling warm, and I wouldn't have a care in the world.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>Trauma, whether experienced through personal events like abuse, neglect, or larger systemic issues like racial violence and oppression, can leave deep psychological and emotional scars. When trauma is unresolved or untreated, it often gets passed down to future generations, shaping how families interact, cope, and express emotions. This is known as intergenerational trauma, and it impacts not only mental health but also relationships, behaviors, and the overall well-being of individuals and communities.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Growth is a process and it's okay to make mistakes. Focus on progress, not perfection. This changed my perspective on how I approach challenges, especially in a demanding academic environment. I used to be hard on myself for not meeting my own high standards or for struggling in subjects I thought I should excel in.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>While my phone is a useful tool for communication and convenience, the Internet opens up a world of knowledge, creativity, and opportunities that go beyond what a phone alone can offer. Without my phone, I can still communicate through other devices and manage most tasks online. Without the Internet, I'd feel disconnected from the larger world.</p>

<br>It always seemed so far-fetched, but I wanted to be an astronaut. My passion was fueled by the thought of reaching heights further than I could imagine. To this day, I find myself daydreaming about exploring the unknown and pushing our limits.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>I love waking after at least seven hours of rest and having the house to myself. I like to work out and do my homework and projects in the mornings. If my afternoon is free, I take my little brothers to the park for a game of basketball. At the end of the day, I like to wind down with a book, movie, or a documentary.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>To address substance abuse among youth, we must provide support, education, and resources to young people. Young people are preyed on with marketing tactics, glamorizing substance use. I hope to help make positive change in my community and continually tackle these issues.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>College is about personal and professional growth, not just a degree and a job.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I chose SDS because I was interested in mathematics/STEM and soon realized that I was interested in coding. I took computer science classes and even though it was a struggle, I wanted to prove to myself and others that I could succeed.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be a teacher because I was always inspired by my elementary school teachers. Teaching seemed like a great way to share knowledge and opportunities with others. Even though I didn't end up following that path, I am still inspired by educators.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>I would spend the day at the beach with my family and friends in the Dominican Republic. There would be fruit and ice cream and delicious food made by my parents. We would make jokes, build sandcastles, and go for a swim in the warm water. Then, we'd go for a bike ride around the trail close to the beach, and head home in the early evening to end the night with a movie or a small campfire with s'mores.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>I care about people feeling seen and included. In STEM careers, it can be hard to believe in yourself because it's not often that you see people like you who come from similar backgrounds. Prioritizing mental health is also important to me because I believe that it's just as important as physical health.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Step outside of your comfort zone and take chances. I believe that I was avoiding my fears for a good reason and felt that I wasn't worthy of certain opportunities, no matter how hard I worked. Thanks to this great advice, it has gotten easier to pursue some amazing opportunities, even when they seem challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>While my phone is an important medium for communication, I would be fine using any Internet-connected device to communicate. It might be nice to not constantly check the phone and disconnect more often.</p>

<br>Computer Science</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I love computers and have been around them my entire life. I believe CS is the best technology to change the world. I took Computer science as a regular high school class, and the next semester, they offered it as an AP course. It was the only AP test I passed that year. Apparently, I understand it easier than other subjects.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be a doctor, a marine biologist, or a scientist. I've always had an affinity for science and love experiments. I loved the process, discovering new things and the ideas that power discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>A perfect day is one where I can do everything on my own schedule. No pressure to get things right and no need to hurry. If I decide I am done with something, I could move on, and no one's upset. Daylight would last for as long as I wanted, and the stars would appear when I am ready for them.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>There's a lack of female representation in computer science. Since high school, I have typically been the lone girl in computer science classes. Young girls tell me that they want to take these courses but feel like they didn't belong. I want to show women that they <em>can</em> study computer science and that even if they're the only girl in the class, they can stand tall and make an impact.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>When I was in high school, I had such a problem accepting failure that it affected my mental health. When I decided to go to college, I was terrified of the issue repeating itself. My boyfriend convinced me that even though failure is inevitable, if you put in the hard work, you can achieve anything you set out to do. I went from almost failing out of high school to being a straight-A student in college. I also became a MESA Mentor for other first-generation, low-income students.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>I am an avid user of my computer, so not having Internet would greatly hinder my ability to get things done. I dislike working on my phone because the mobile equivalents to computer applications are often ill-equipped and annoying to work with.</p>

<br>Environmental Science</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I am passionate about understanding the intricate connections between natural ecosystems and human society. Growing up in a diverse, urban area like San Francisco, I witnessed firsthand how environmental issues like pollution and climate change disproportionately affect marginalized communities. My major allows me to explore solutions for these challenges and work toward a sustainable, equitable future.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I envisioned myself as a science and math educator because I saw firsthand how many of my classmates struggled to grasp these subjects. I recognized early on that it wasn't just about the difficulty of the material but also about the lack of resources and encouragement they received. My goal was to uplift others, foster their growth, and help them become the best versions of themselves, just as my teachers helped me.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>As a San Francisco native who loves the cold, I would require a bit of fog and rain, my favorite weather. Those are ripe conditions for a day full of reading and engaging with topics in marine or climate sciences&sbquo; whether it be at an aquarium or a zoo.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>I am concerned with how climate change and pollution affect marginalized communities. These groups often lack access to resources and are more vulnerable to the impacts of environmental degradation. I care about bridging these gaps and advocating for sustainable solutions that address both environmental and social inequities.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>You are worth more than your grades. This advice helped me shift my focus toward genuine learning and personal growth, which has allowed me to excel beyond academics. Previously, I focused too much on memorizing facts and achieving high marks instead of engaging more deeply with the material and building connections with faculty and peers.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>Taking a break from the Internet would free up more time to visit friends, borrow books from the library, or finally visit my professor's office hours. A break from the constant influx of emails, notifications, and texts would offer a serene, anxiety-free day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose your major?</strong>
<br>I like learning about technology and loved my AP biology class. I wanted to major in something that would allow me to learn more about technology and to apply biological principles in my field of work. I plan to specialize in tissue engineering which would involve different kinds of technology to collect, grow, and monitor the necessary cell cultures needed to grow the needed tissue.</p>
<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong>
<br>I wanted to be a doctor because I think it's cool to help people. Eventually, I learned about the burden that doctors undertake and didn't think I was ready for that.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong>
<br>The ideal day is one where I get to enjoy time with people that I value without any stress weighing my mind down. I have the most fun hanging out with my friends, so what else could make it more perfect? Getting some good sleep and waking up refreshed and ready to start my day with plans in place on what me and my friends are going to do. After hanging out, I would go home, take a shower, and go straight to bed, as sometimes I struggle to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong>
<br>I care about seeing people get along. It painful to watch people get manipulated into looking at others as enemies, something that happens far too much in politics around the world.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Take an active role in your campus experience. I've learned a lot about university programs and who to contact with my concerns. Unfortunately, it is somewhat frequent for my friends not to know about the resources available on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>If I go without a phone, would I still have other devices? If I have a tablet, that's just a mobile phone without a calling functionality. I can install software to make phone calls.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong>
<br>Don't compare yourself to others &mdash; only compare yourself to the version of yourself you were yesterday. Being a community college student, seeing so many of my peers in high school go on to live lives full of opportunity and excitement as they went to state schools felt shameful. I realized that I was hindering my own growth by comparing myself to people who were in completely different circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong>
<br>Without my phone, I could still communicate with my friends and community via the Internet. With virtual phone applications, I'd still be productive and wouldn't need to put my life on hold.</p>
