I enrolled in an Introduction to Programming course and loved it, even when I struggled. After this class, I decided computer science is what I wanted to pursue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you want to be as a kid?</strong><br>\nI wanted to be a teacher. I have a little sister who is seven years younger, and whenever my mom would be busy around the house, I would begin teaching my sister fun math problems to solve. I also assigned her homework that I would make up and grade. I loved putting gold star stickers on her assignments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong><br>\nThe day would start with breakfast with my family in the backyard. Afterward, I'd make my way to the beach in Jenner, California, which is one of my favorite places. I'd go on a picnic with my best friends and take photos with my Polaroid. Later, my family and I would go watch a movie in theaters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What social or societal challenge do you care most about?</strong><br>\nFood insecurity is a big stressor which can lead to health and social issues and a decline in educational achievement. Mental health is a topic which has been looked down upon, especially in immigrant households. Creating a more supportive environment that encourages being able to speak up and prioritize mental health would be amazing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the best advice you received in college?</strong><br>\nApply for an opportunity, even if you don't fit all the requirements or don't feel like you can do it. There is a fear of failure, and you need to get out of your comfort zone to build confidence. We miss all the shots we don't take.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you rather be without Internet or your phone?</strong><br>\nI would rather be without my phone because if I still have Internet access, I can use other devices to stay connected and be entertained.</p>"
